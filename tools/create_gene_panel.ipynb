    "The objective is to automate the retrieval of genes from GTR and save them in a structured JSON format for further analysis."

    "## Obtaining GTR Test Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before executing the notebook, a text file containing GTR test identifiers must be created.  \n",
    "Each line in the file should contain a single GTR test ID.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe how to obtain these identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the MeSH ID for the disease**\n",
    "   - Access the [MeSH Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh).\n",
    "   - Search for the desired disease (e.g., \"breast cancer\").\n",
    "   - Record the **MeSH ID** listed in the entry (for breast cancer, the MeSH ID is `D001943`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Locate related panels in MedGen**\n",
    "   - Visit [MedGen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen).\n",
    "   - Search using the MeSH ID (e.g., `D001943`).\n",
    "   - On the disease page, navigate to the section titled **Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)** .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect GTR Test IDs**\n",
    "   - In the GTR section, each linked test corresponds to a genetic panel.\n",
    "   - Click on a test name (e.g., \"Breast/Gyn Cancer Panel\"); the URL will include the test ID, for example:  \n",
    "     `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/tests/569831/` → Test ID: `569831`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create the input file**\n",
    "   - Create a file named `gene_panels_ids.txt`.\n",
    "   - Add one ID per line, for example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     569831\n",
    "     560453\n",
    "     600459\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Save the file in the `tools/` directory so that the full path is `tools/gene_panels_ids.txt`."
